# Tormar Studios Database

This code sets up a SQLite database named "tormar_studios.db" and creates a table called "tormar_studios". The table has three columns: "madeYear", "warriorName", and "city".

The code then inserts some data into the table using the executemany method, and prints all the rows in the table using a for loop and the execute method.

Finally, the code executes a select statement to search for specific rows in the table and prints the results.
